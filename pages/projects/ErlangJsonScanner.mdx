# Erlang json scanner

This project was used as a review on how compilers work, specifically the recogniser and scanner part of the pipeline. I also wanted to refresh using a untyped/dynamically-typed functional language like erlang and try to implement something real world, specifically a recogniser in json.

This project allowed me to understand what JSON is and refresh on how a recogniser is built.

More plans will be made into this project such as adding test coverages and making this project
into a JSON marshaller for erlang.
