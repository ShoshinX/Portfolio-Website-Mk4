# Huffman Coding Implementation

There was a specific field in computer science that wasn't taught in UNSW. Mainly, Compression and Codes. Fortunately, I was given the chance to create my own mini-report on this field in one of my courses called Advanced algorithms (COMP4121).

The report let me explore the meaning of information and what entropy means in the context of codes. In addition, I implemented a compression algorithm called the Huffman code.
