# Raytracing Projects

Graphics. I did not touch graphics when I was in UNSW. Primarily because I was interested in the layers between developer code and the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). I mainly used Zig, and Rust to implement the Raytracing in the Weekend Book. It exposed me to novel concepts like anti-aliasing, creating objects, and creating a viewport. It's a good book to understand graphics, but I will continue to delve deeper into graphics since I could not connect the part where game logic intersects with graphics.
