# SchemeIn48Hrs

I was obssessed with correctness and validity, so I wanted to use haskell in everything. 
As a result, I used the Scheme in 48 Hrs project as a practice project on using Haskell.
Furthermore, after going through the compilers course in UNSW, I wanted to try implementing
an interpreter in a language that I'm not familiar with like Scheme.

Overall, this project has shown me multiple ways of parsing like using Parsec, and a new language I have never seen like Scheme. Plus, I also start to like how Haskell structures their code with  the impure side effect functions on the outside of the pure functions.
