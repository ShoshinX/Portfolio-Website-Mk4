# Personal Website Create React App with a Globe

This project started because I wanted to have a globe in my personal website just like stripe and
that I want to move away from Jekyll.

One of the fastest ways, I've experienced building a website was with create-react-app(CRA) and chakra UI. In addition, there was already a react-globe package that I can use from npm. I also wanted
it to focus on a dark theme.

As a result, [***shoshinprograms.com***](https://shoshinprograms.com) was born.

There's a few caveats that I realised when I finished building this website. My site which was
previously searchable in Google was not searchable now because CRA was a client side rendered website. Google searches are usually possible on Server side rendered websites or statically generated ones. In addition, picking the correct fonts and handling responsiveness of the app was
hard since I didn't really understand how to customise the react globe component correctly.
